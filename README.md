# MovieBooking
Vanilla JS project working with the DOM

This project is the second project in Brad Traversy's Udemy course: 20 JavaScript Projects.  I am working through these as I study the Modern JS course from the same author.

The app specification:
## Movie Seat Booking

Display movie choices and seats in a theater to select from in order to purchase tickets

## Project Specifications

- Display UI with movie select, screen, seats, legend & seat info
- User can select a movie/price
- User can select/deselect seats
- User can not select occupied seats
- Number of seats and price will update
- Save seats, movie and price to local storage so that UI is still populated on refresh
